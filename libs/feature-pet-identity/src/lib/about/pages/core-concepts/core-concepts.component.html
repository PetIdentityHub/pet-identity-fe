    <h1>Core Concepts</h1>
    <h2>PetProfile (PetIdentity)</h2>
    <p>
        PetProfile serves as a digital manifestation of our pets' lives, much
        like our own digital footprints. As humans, we have traces of our
        education, work experience, places we've been, medical records, and
        personal connections. These all contribute to our identity and how
        others perceive us. Pets are no different in this regard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Creating a PetProfile is the first step towards consolidating all of a
        pet's experiences in one unique, ID document-like location. You provide
        essential information about your pet, then collect digital "Pieces" or
        footprints, such as veterinary visits, breeder certificates, and other
        pet-related activities. These Pieces are then linked to your pet's
        profile.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the freedom to use these Pieces as you wish - share them with
        others or keep them private for you and your pet. PetProfile offers a
        centralized and convenient way to store, manage, and access your pet's
        information and history.

    <h2>Issuer</h2>
    <p>
        Every identity requires another entity to verify our experiences, much
        like a birth certificate confirms our place and date of birth, or a
        university diploma validates our knowledge and expertise in a specific
        field. Our pets, too, have such entities. Veterinarians maintain health
        records, contest organizers provide proof of participation, and animal
        breeders authenticate pedigrees.
    </p>
    <p>
        Becoming an issuer not only streamlines the process of issuing and
        verifying proofs but also contributes to a more sustainable and
        eco-friendly approach. Being an issuer can help build the reputation of
        the institution, demonstrating their commitment to transparency,
        security, and innovation.
    </p>

    <h2>Operator</h2>
    <p>
        The Operator is a crucial entity within our project, designed to ensure
        the authenticity and credibility of issuers. Operators possess
        sufficient privileges to confirm the identity of individuals or
        institutions applying to become issuers. They serve as a gatekeeper,
        maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of our platform.
    </p>

    <h2>Piece</h2>
    <p>
        Piece is the core component of our solution, serving as the "digital
        fingerprint" that represents various aspects of a pet's life. Leveraging
        the power of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) or Soulbound Tokens (SBTs),
        Pieces can be registered and minted by issuers, and then collected and
        associated with a unique PetProfile.
    </p>
    <p>
        By collecting and connecting these Pieces to a PetProfile, pet owners
        can create a comprehensive, digital portfolio of their pet's life
        experiences and accomplishments, which can be shared or kept private as
        desired.
