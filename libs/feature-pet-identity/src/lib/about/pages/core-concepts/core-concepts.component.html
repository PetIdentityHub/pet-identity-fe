            <h2>PetProfile (PetIdentity)</h2>
            <p>
                PetProfile serves as a digital manifestation of our pets' lives,
                much like our own digital footprints. As humans, we have traces
                of our education, work experience, places we've been, medical
                records, and personal connections. These all contribute to our
                identity and how others perceive us. Pets are no different in
                this regard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating a PetProfile is the first step towards consolidating
                all of a pet's experiences in one unique, ID document-like
                location. You provide essential information about your pet, then
                collect digital "Pieces" or footprints, such as veterinary
                visits, breeder certificates, and other pet-related activities.
                These Pieces are then linked to your pet's profile.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have the freedom to use these Pieces as you wish - share
                them with others or keep them private for you and your pet.
                PetProfile offers a centralized and convenient way to store,
                manage, and access your pet's information and history.
            </p>
            </div>

            <div *ngIf="activeSection === 'issuer'">
            <h2>Issuer</h2>
            <p>
                Every identity requires another entity to verify our
                experiences, much like a birth certificate confirms our place
                and date of birth, or a university diploma validates our
                knowledge and expertise in a specific field. Our pets, too, have
                such entities. Veterinarians maintain health records, contest
                organizers provide proof of participation, and animal breeders
                authenticate pedigrees.
            </p>
            <p>
                Becoming an issuer not only streamlines the process of issuing
                and verifying proofs but also contributes to a more sustainable
                and eco-friendly approach. Being an issuer can help build the
                reputation of the institution, demonstrating their commitment to
                transparency, security, and innovation.

            <div *ngIf="activeSection === 'operator'">
            <h2>Operator</h2>
            <p>
                The Operator is a crucial entity within our project, designed to
                ensure the authenticity and credibility of issuers. Operators
                possess sufficient privileges to confirm the identity of
                individuals or institutions applying to become issuers. They
                serve as a gatekeeper, maintaining the integrity and
                trustworthiness of our platform.
            </p>
            </div>

            <div *ngIf="activeSection === 'piece'">
            <h2>Piece</h2>
            <p>
                Piece is the core component of our solution, serving as the
                "digital fingerprint" that represents various aspects of a pet's
                life. Leveraging the power of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) or
                Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), Pieces can be registered and minted by
                issuers, and then collected and associated with a unique
                PetProfile.
            </p>
            <p>
                By collecting and connecting these Pieces to a PetProfile, pet
                owners can create a comprehensive, digital portfolio of their
                pet's life experiences and accomplishments, which can be shared
                or kept private as desired.
